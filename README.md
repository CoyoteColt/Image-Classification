# Classification of satellite images
This repository aims to explore and understand the world of image classification, covering how it works, the technologies involved and the tools used. Through this repository, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts of image classification, including machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and data preprocessing techniques.

## Introduction
This project aims to facilitate the analysis of satellite images, automating the task of classifying land and structures. The algorithm is trained to recognize different classes, such as forests, urban areas, bodies of watere and we will use the convulational neural networks.

## Functionalities
Key functionalities include detecting and classifying land cover types (such as forests, urban areas, water bodies), monitoring environmental changes (such as deforestation and urban growth), analyzing vegetation health, detecting natural disasters (such as floods and forest fires), and the contribution to precision agriculture through crop monitoring and yield forecasting. These algorithms use machine learning and image processing techniques to automate and improve the accuracy of these analyses.


## Technologies Used
Although it is not a very complex project, we have a wide range of tools used, the main ones we have the framework that helps us create convulational neural network models. In this version we use Pytorch, sklearn to obtain some metrics and other very important tools such as numpy , matplolib, numba, shutil among others.
